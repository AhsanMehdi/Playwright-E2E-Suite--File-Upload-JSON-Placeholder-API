pip install robotframework-retryfailed

Usage
Add the listener to your robot execution, via command line arguments. When your tests do fail and you have tagged them with test:retry(2), it will retry the test 2 times. Retry can be also set globally as a parameter to the listener.

Attaching Listener
Example:

robot --listener RetryFailed <your robot suite>

robot --listener RetryFailed:1 <robot suite>

Second one will by default retry once every failing test.

Tagging Tests
Example:

*** Test Cases ***
Test Case
    [Tags]    test:retry(2)
    Log    This test will be retried 2 times if it fails

Tagging tasks by task:retry(3) should also work.

Wait Until Keyword Succeeds
Runs the specified keyword and retries if it fails.

Check out the Wait Until Keyword Succeeds keyword in the Robot Framework BuiltIn library.

Example:

*** Test Cases ***
Test Case
    Wait Until Keyword Succeeds    2 min    5 sec    My keyword    argument
    ${result}    Wait Until Keyword Succeeds    3x    200ms    My keyword
    ${result}    Wait Until Keyword Succeeds	3x    strict: 200ms    My keyword
